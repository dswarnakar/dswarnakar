### 👨‍💼 About Me

I lead large-scale IT operations and digital workplace platforms for global teams, with a focus on reliability, security, and cost discipline. With 25+ years across architecture, operations, and IT leadership, I translate business priorities into scalable, practical technology solutions.

My experience spans global infrastructure projects and operations, cloud platforms, and close collaboration with R&D, business systems, and IT groups, as well as strategic vendors and partners. I have led distributed teams, managed complex portfolios and multi-million-dollar budgets, and delivered measurable savings through modernization, consolidation, optimization, and vendor negotiations.

I bring a hands-on leadership style, strong stakeholder engagement, and a bias for execution—improving service reliability, accelerating transformation, and building high-performing teams that can operate in fast-moving, high-growth environments.
